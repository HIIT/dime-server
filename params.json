{"name":"Dime-server","tagline":"Your humble Digital Work Me (DiMe) server.","body":"# Digital Work Me (DiMe) server\r\n\r\nThe DiMe server can run in your local machine or in a server. Its task\r\nis to collect your personal data from different loggers into a central\r\nplace that you control.\r\n\r\nYou can install DiMe directly on your machine (instructions below), or\r\nif you are adventurous test the experimental\r\n[Docker virtualisation](https://github.com/HIIT/dime-server/wiki/Docker)\r\nsupport. For people intending to develop, it is probably easier to\r\ninstall it directly.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n[Java 7 JDK][1] or newer (i.e. Java version 1.7 or newer) is required.\r\n\r\nFor Mac OS X you need to have\r\n[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed first. You can\r\ninstall it from the Apple Mac App Store.\r\n\r\n### Compiling\r\n\r\nFirst, clone the git repository, for example via the command line:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/HIIT/dime-server.git\r\n\r\nTo compile, just run:\r\n\r\n    make\r\n\r\n(If you don't have GNU Make installed you can also use [gradle][4]\r\ndirectly: `./gradlew assemble`.)\r\n\r\nIn the first compilation, it will download any Java dependencies\r\nautomatically. Hence it may take a bit longer the first time.\r\n\r\n### Running\r\n\r\nTo run the server in port 8080 issue the command:\r\n\r\n    make run\r\n    \r\n**Note for Mac Users**: if you use Xcode, using `make run` to run DiMe might cause conflicts. In this case, use the alternate command:\r\n\r\n\t./gradlew run\r\n\t\r\nTo start DiMe.\r\n\r\n(`./gradlew run` can always be used as an alternative to `make run` if you don't have GNU Make.)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to change the TCP port of the server take a look at how to\r\n[configure the DiMe server][2] to use another port.\r\n\r\nThe DiMe server will put all its files, such as the database and\r\nLucene search index under `~/.dime` in your home directory.\r\n\r\nNow you can access the DiMe dashboard by going to the address\r\n<http://localhost:8080>.\r\n\r\nWhen you run DiMe the first time it will automatically create an\r\n`admin` user and show its randomly generated password in the command\r\nline.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe [project wiki page][3] has more detailed instructions and\r\ndocumentation of the API and development.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact the lead\r\ndeveloper [Mats Sj√∂berg](mailto:mats.sjoberg@helsinki.fi).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe DiMe server source code is licensed under\r\n[the MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\r\n[2]: https://github.com/HIIT/dime-server/wiki/Configuration\r\n[3]: https://github.com/HIIT/dime-server/wiki\r\n[4]: http://gradle.org/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
